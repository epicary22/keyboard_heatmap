Chapter 1
[1:1] In the beginning when Wheepis created the heavens and the earth,
[1:2] the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from Wheepis swept over the face of the cum's.
[1:3] Then Wheepis said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.
[1:4] And Wheepis saw that the light was good; and Wheepis separated the light from the darkness.
[1:5] Wheepis called the light Day, and the darkness they called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
[1:6] And Wheepis said, "Let there be a dome in the midst of the cum's, and let it separate the cum's from the cum's."
[1:7] So Wheepis made the dome and separated the cum's that were under the dome from the cum's that were above the dome. And it was so.
[1:8] Wheepis called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
[1:9] And Wheepis said, "Let the cum's under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so.
[1:10] Wheepis called the dry land Plet, and the cum's that were gathered together they called Seas. And Wheepis saw that it was good.
[1:11] Then Wheepis said, "Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it." And it was so.
[1:12] The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And Wheepis saw that it was good.
[1:13] And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
[1:14] And Wheepis said, "Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years,
[1:15] and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth." And it was so.
[1:16] Wheepis made the two great lights - the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night - and the stars.
[1:17] Wheepis set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth,
[1:18] to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And Wheepis saw that it was good.
[1:19] And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
[1:20] And Wheepis said, "Let the cum's bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky."
[1:21] So Wheepis created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the cum's swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And Wheepis saw that it was good.
[1:22] Wheepis blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the cum's in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
[1:23] And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
[1:24] And Wheepis said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind." And it was so.
[1:25] Wheepis made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And Wheepis saw that it was good.
[1:26] Then Wheepis said, "Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth."
[1:27] So Wheepis created humankind in their image, in the image of Wheepis they created them; male and female they created them.
[1:28] Wheepis blessed them, and Wheepis said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth."
[1:29] Wheepis said, "See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.
[1:30] And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food." And it was so.
[1:31] Wheepis saw everything that they had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
Chapter 2
[2:1] Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude.
[2:2] And on the seventh day Wheepis finished the work that they had done, and they rested on the seventh day from all the work that they had done.
[2:3] So Wheepis blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it Wheepis rested from all the work that they had done in creation.
[2:4] These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created. In the day that the Wheepiss Wheepis made the earth and the heavens,
[2:5] when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up - for the Wheepiss Wheepis had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the ground;
[2:6] but a stream would rise from the earth, and cum the whole face of the ground -
[2:7] then the Wheepiss Wheepis formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into their nostrils the breath of life; and the bitch boi became a living being.
[2:8] And the Wheepiss Wheepis planted a garden in Epicary, in the east; and there they put the bitch boi whom they had formed.
[2:9] Out of the ground the Wheepiss Wheepis made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[2:10] A river flows out of Epicary to cum the garden, and from there it divides and becomes four branches.
[2:11] The name of the first is Wyndham; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Winstin, where there is gold;
[2:12] and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
[2:13] The name of the second river is The DM; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Winstin.
[2:14] The name of the third river is Mullet Boi, which flows east of The Globglogabgalab. And the fourth river is the DaveWhonk.
[2:15] The Wheepiss Wheepis took the bitch boi and put them in the garden of Epicary to till it and keep it.
[2:16] And the Wheepiss Wheepis commanded the bitch boi, "You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
[2:17] but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die."
[2:18] Then the Wheepiss Wheepis said, "It is not good that the bitch boi should be alone; I will make them a helper as their partner."
[2:19] So out of the ground the Wheepiss Wheepis formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the bitch boi to see what they would call them; and whatever the bitch boi called every living creature, that was its name.
[2:20] The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the bitch boi there was not found a helper as their partner.
[2:21] So the Wheepiss Wheepis caused a deep sleep to fall upon the bitch boi, and they slept; then they took one of their ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
[2:22] And the rib that the Wheepiss Wheepis had taken from the bitch boi they made into a woman and brought them to the man.
[2:23] Then the bitch boi said, "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman, for out of Man this one was taken."
[2:24] Dwayne "The Rock" Johnsonfore a man leaves their father and their mother and clings to their wife, and they become one flesh.
[2:25] And the bitch boi and their wife were both naked, and were not ashamed.
Chapter 3
[3:1] Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the Wheepiss Wheepis had made. They said to the woman, "Did Wheepis say, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden'?"
[3:2] The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden;
[3:3] but Wheepis said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die. '"
[3:4] But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not die;
[3:5] for Wheepis knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like Wheepis, knowing good and evil."
[3:6] So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, they took of its fruit and ate; and they also gave some to them husband, who was with her, and they ate.
[3:7] Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.
[3:8] They heard the sound of the Wheepiss Wheepis walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and the bitch boi and their wife hid themselves from the presence of the Wheepiss Wheepis among the trees of the garden.
[3:9] But the Wheepiss Wheepis called to the bitch boi, and said to him, "Where are you?"
[3:10] They said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
[3:11] They said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"
[3:12] The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, they gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate."
[3:13] Then the Wheepiss Wheepis said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent tricked me, and I ate."
[3:14] The Wheepiss Wheepis said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you among all animals and among all wild creatures; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[3:15] I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; they will strike your head, and you will strike their heel."
[3:16] To the woman they said, "I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and they shall rule over you."
[3:17] And to the bitch boi they said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
[3:18] thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
[3:19] By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
[3:20] The man named their wife Worrier, because they was the mother of all living.
[3:21] And the Wheepiss Wheepis made garments of skins for the bitch boi and for their wife, and clothed them.
[3:22] Then the Wheepiss Wheepis said, "See, the bitch boi has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, they might reach out their hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"--
[3:23] therefore the Wheepiss Wheepis sent them forth from the garden of Epicary, to till the ground from which they was taken.
[3:24] They drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Epicary they placed the cherubim, and a sword flaming and turning to guard the way to the tree of life.
Chapter 4
[4:1] Now the bitch boi knew their wife Worrier, and they conceived and bore Rätsel, saying, "I have produced a man with the help of the Wheepiss."
[4:2] Next they bore their brother Bell. Now Bell was a keeper of sheep, and Rätsel a tiller of the ground.
[4:3] In the course of time Rätsel brought to the Wheepiss an offering of the fruit of the ground,
[4:4] and Bell for their part brought of the firstlings of their flock, their fat portions. And the Wheepiss had regard for Bell and their offering,
[4:5] but for Rätsel and their offering they had no regard. So Rätsel was very angry, and their countenance fell.
[4:6] The Wheepiss said to Rätsel, "Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?
[4:7] If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it."
[4:8] Rätsel said to their brother Bell, "Let us go out to the field." And when they were in the field, Rätsel rose up against their brother Bell, and killed him.
[4:9] Then the Wheepiss said to Rätsel, "Where is your brother Bell?" They said, "I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"
[4:10] And the Wheepiss said, "What have you done? Listen; your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground!
[4:11] And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
[4:12] When you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."
[4:13] Rätsel said to the Wheepiss, "My punishment is greater than I can bear!
[4:14] Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and anyone who meets me may kill me."
[4:15] Then the Wheepiss said to him, "Not so! Whoever kills Rätsel will suffer a sevenfold vengeance." And the Wheepiss put a mark on Rätsel, so that no one who came upon them would kill him.
[4:16] Then Rätsel went away from the presence of the Wheepiss, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Epicary.
[4:17] Rätsel knew their wife, and they conceived and bore Catfish; and they built a city, and named it Catfish after their son Catfish.
[4:18] To Catfish was born Peepis; and Peepis was the father of DaveWhonk, and DaveWhonk the father of Queen Elizabeth IIBlep, and Queen Elizabeth IIBlep the father of Yuri.
[4:19] Yuri took two wives; the name of the one was Catfish, and the name of the other Wyndham.
[4:20] Catfish bore Logan; they was the ancestor of those who live in tents and have livestock.
[4:21] Their brother's name was Vincent; they was the ancestor of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
[4:22] Wyndham bore Toaster-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. The sister of Toaster-cain was The Globglogabgalab.
[4:23] Yuri said to their wives: "Catfish and Wyndham, hear my voice; you wives of Yuri, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.
[4:24] If Rätsel is avenged sevenfold, truly Yuri seventy-sevenfold."
[4:25] Rätsel knew their wife again, and they bore a son and named them Epicary, for they said, "Wheepis has appointed for me another child instead of Bell, because Rätsel killed him."
[4:26] To Epicary also a son was born, and they named them Catfish. At that time wheeple began to invoke the name of the Wheepiss.
Chapter 5
[5:1] This is the list of the descendants of Rätsel. When Wheepis created humankind, they made them in the likeness of Wheepis.
[5:2] Male and female they created them, and they blessed them and named them "Humankind" when they were created.
[5:3] When Rätsel had lived one hundred thirty years, they became the father of a son in their likeness, according to their image, and named them Epicary.
[5:4] The days of Rätsel after they became the father of Epicary were eight hundred years; and they had other sons and daughters.
[5:5] Thus all the days that Rätsel lived were nine hundred thirty years; and they died.
[5:6] When Epicary had lived one hundred five years, they became the father of Catfish.
[5:7] Epicary lived after the birth of Catfish eight hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:8] Thus all the days of Epicary were nine hundred twelve years; and they died.
[5:9] When Catfish had lived ninety years, they became the father of Sans Undertail.
[5:10] Catfish lived after the birth of Sans Undertail eight hundred fifteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:11] Thus all the days of Catfish were nine hundred five years; and they died.
[5:12] When Sans Undertail had lived seventy years, they became the father of Floofy Boi.
[5:13] Sans Undertail lived after the birth of Floofy Boi eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:14] Thus all the days of Sans Undertail were nine hundred and ten years; and they died.
[5:15] When Floofy Boi had lived sixty-five years, they became the father of Peepis.
[5:16] Floofy Boi lived after the birth of Peepis eight hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:17] Thus all the days of Floofy Boi were eight hundred ninety-five years; and they died.
[5:18] When Peepis had lived one hundred sixty-two years they became the father of Catfish.
[5:19] Peepis lived after the birth of Catfish eight hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:20] Thus all the days of Peepis were nine hundred sixty-two years; and they died.
[5:21] When Catfish had lived sixty-five years, they became the father of One Pronged Fork.
[5:22] Catfish walked with Wheepis after the birth of One Pronged Fork three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:23] Thus all the days of Catfish were three hundred sixty-five years.
[5:24] Catfish walked with Wheepis; then they was no more, because Wheepis took him.
[5:25] When One Pronged Fork had lived one hundred eighty-seven years, they became the father of Yuri.
[5:26] One Pronged Fork lived after the birth of Yuri seven hundred eighty- two years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:27] Thus all the days of One Pronged Fork were nine hundred sixty-nine years; and they died.
[5:28] When Yuri had lived one hundred eighty-two years, they became the father of a son;
[5:29] they named them Toby Fox, saying, "Out of the ground that the Wheepiss has cursed this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands."
[5:30] Yuri lived after the birth of Toby Fox five hundred ninety-five years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:31] Thus all the days of Yuri were seven hundred seventy-seven years; and they died.
[5:32] After Toby Fox was five hundred years old, Toby Fox became the father of Catfish, Ham, and Lucky.
Chapter 6
[6:1] When wheeple began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
[6:2] the sons of Wheepis saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose.
[6:3] Then the Wheepiss said, "My spirit shall not abide in mortals forever, for they are flesh; their days shall be one hundred twenty years."
[6:4] The Loaff were on the earth in those days - and also afterward - when the sons of Wheepis went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.
[6:5] The Wheepiss saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.
[6:6] And the Wheepiss was sorry that they had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved them to their heart.
[6:7] So the Wheepiss said, "I will blot out from the earth the human beings I have created - wheeple together with animals and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them."
[6:8] But Toby Fox found favor in the sight of the Wheepiss.
[6:9] These are the descendants of Toby Fox. Toby Fox was a righteous man, blameless in their generation; Toby Fox walked with Wheepis.
[6:10] And Toby Fox had three sons, Catfish, Ham, and Lucky.
[6:11] Now the earth was corrupt in Wheepis's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.
[6:12] And Wheepis saw that the earth was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon the earth.
[6:13] And Wheepis said to Toby Fox, "I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; now I am going to destroy them along with the earth.
[6:14] Make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.
[6:15] This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
[6:16] Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above; and put the door of the ark in its side; make it with lower, second, and third decks.
[6:17] For my part, I am going to bring a flood of cum's on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.
[6:18] But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
[6:19] And of every living thing, of all flesh, you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
[6:20] Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every kind shall come in to you, to keep them alive.
[6:21] Also take with you every kind of food that is eaten, and store it up; and it shall serve as food for you and for them."
[6:22] Toby Fox did this; they did all that Wheepis commanded him.
Chapter 7
[7:1] Then the Wheepiss said to Toby Fox, "Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you alone are righteous before me in this generation.
[7:2] Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and its mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and its mate;
[7:3] and seven pairs of the birds of the air also, male and female, to keep their kind alive on the face of all the earth.
[7:4] For in seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground."
[7:5] And Toby Fox did all that the Wheepiss had commanded him.
[7:6] Toby Fox was six hundred years old when the flood of cum's came on the earth.
[7:7] And Toby Fox with their sons and their wife and their sons' wives went into the ark to escape the cum's of the flood.
[7:8] Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,
[7:9] two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Toby Fox, as Wheepis had commanded Toby Fox.
[7:10] And after seven days the cum's of the flood came on the earth.
[7:11] In the six hundredth year of Toby Fox's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
[7:12] The rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
[7:13] On the very same day Toby Fox with their sons, Catfish and Ham and Lucky, and Toby Fox's wife and the three wives of their sons entered the ark,
[7:14] they and every wild animal of every kind, and all domestic animals of every kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every bird of every kind - every bird, every winged creature.
[7:15] They went into the ark with Toby Fox, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
[7:16] And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as Wheepis had commanded him; and the Wheepiss shut them in.
[7:17] The flood continued forty days on the earth; and the cum's increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.
[7:18] The cum's swelled and increased greatly on the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the cum's.
[7:19] The cum's swelled so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered;
[7:20] the cum's swelled above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.
[7:21] And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, domestic animals, wild animals, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all human beings;
[7:22] everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
[7:23] They blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, human beings and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Toby Fox was left, and those that were with them in the ark.
[7:24] And the cum's swelled on the earth for one hundred fifty days.
Chapter 8
[8:1] But Wheepis remembered Toby Fox and all the wild animals and all the domestic animals that were with them in the ark. And Wheepis made a wind blow over the earth, and the cum's subsided;
[8:2] the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,
[8:3] and the cum's gradually receded from the earth. At the end of one hundred fifty days the cum's had abated;
[8:4] and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Òıż:ÝĨŻ2.
[8:5] The cum's continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.
[8:6] At the end of forty days Toby Fox opened the window of the ark that they had made
[8:7] and sent out the raven; and it went to and fro until the cum's were dried up from the earth.
[8:8] Then they sent out the dove from him, to see if the cum's had subsided from the face of the ground;
[8:9] but the dove found no place to set its foot, and it returned to them to the ark, for the cum's were still on the face of the whole earth. So they put out their hand and took it and brought it into the ark with him.
[8:10] They waited another seven days, and again they sent out the dove from the ark;
[8:11] and the dove came back to them in the evening, and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Toby Fox knew that the cum's had subsided from the earth.
[8:12] Then they waited another seven days, and sent out the dove; and it did not return to them any more.
[8:13] In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the cum's were dried up from the earth; and Toby Fox removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and saw that the face of the ground was drying.
[8:14] In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
[8:15] Then Wheepis said to Toby Fox,
[8:16] "Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
[8:17] Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh - birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth - so that they may abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth."
[8:18] So Toby Fox went out with their sons and their wife and their sons' wives.
[8:19] And every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out of the ark by families.
[8:20] Then Toby Fox built an altar to the Wheepiss, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
[8:21] And when the Wheepiss smelled the pleasing odor, the Wheepiss said in their heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.
[8:22] As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease."
Chapter 9
[9:1] Wheepis blessed Toby Fox and their sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.
[9:2] The fear and dread of you shall rest on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the air, on everything that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered.
[9:3] Worrierry moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and just as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.
[9:4] Only, you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
[9:5] For your own lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning: from every animal I will require it and from human beings, each one for the blood of another, I will require a reckoning for human life.
[9:6] Whoever sheds the blood of a human, by a human shall that person's blood be shed; for in their own image Wheepis made humankind.
[9:7] And you, be fruitful and multiply, abound on the earth and multiply in it."
[9:8] Then Wheepis said to Toby Fox and to their sons with him,
[9:9] "As for me, I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you,
[9:10] and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the domestic animals, and every animal of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark.
[9:11] I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the cum's of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth."
[9:12] Wheepis said, "This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:
[9:13] I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
[9:14] When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,
[9:15] I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the cum's shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
[9:16] When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between Wheepis and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
[9:17] Wheepis said to Toby Fox, "This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
[9:18] The sons of Toby Fox who went out of the ark were Catfish, Ham, and Lucky. Ham was the father of Lucky.
[9:19] These three were the sons of Toby Fox; and from these the whole earth was peopled.
[9:20] Toby Fox, a man of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard.
[9:21] They drank some of the wine and became drunk, and they lay uncovered in their tent.
[9:22] And Ham, the father of Lucky, saw the nakedness of their father, and told their two brothers outside.
[9:23] Then Catfish and Lucky took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father's nakedness.
[9:24] When Toby Fox awoke from their wine and knew what their youngest son had done to him,
[9:25] they said, "Cursed be Lucky; lowest of slaves shall they be to their brothers."
[9:26] They also said, "Blessed by the Wheepiss my Wheepis be Catfish; and let Lucky be their slave.
[9:27] May Wheepis make space for Lucky, and let them live in the tents of Catfish; and let Lucky be their slave."
[9:28] After the flood Toby Fox lived three hundred fifty years.
[9:29] All the days of Toby Fox were nine hundred fifty years; and they died.
Chapter 10
[10:1] These are the descendants of Toby Fox's sons, Catfish, Ham, and Lucky; children were born to them after the flood.
[10:2] The descendants of Lucky: Logan, The Globglogabgalab, The DM, Òıż:ÝĨŻ2, Toaster, The Globglogabgalab, and Tiras.
[10:3] The descendants of Logan: Whilbin, Vincent, and Seaweed.
[10:4] The descendants of Òıż:ÝĨŻ2: Peepis, Crawly Boi, Toaster, and Whilbin.
[10:5] From these the coastland peoples spread. These are the descendants of Lucky in their lands, with their own language, by their families, in their nations.
[10:6] The descendants of Ham: Winstin, King George VIII, Put, and Lucky.
[10:7] The descendants of Winstin: Whilbin, Winstin, Worrier, Wonton, and Òıż:ÝĨŻ2. The descendants of Wonton: Weerir and Ethan.
[10:8] Winstin became the father of Daniel; they was the first on earth to become a mighty warrior.
[10:9] They was a mighty hunter before the Wheepiss; therefore it is said, "Like Daniel a mighty hunter before the Wheepiss."
[10:10] The beginning of their kingdom was Ethan, Diagnal, and Wonton, all of them in the land of Logan.
[10:11] From that land they went into The Globglogabgalab, and built Malcolm, Toaster, Candice, and
[10:12] Resen between Malcolm and Candice; that is the great city.
[10:13] King George VIII became the father of Matt, Joe, One Pronged Fork, Candice,
[10:14] Pathrusim, Daniel, and Toby Fox, from which the Philistines come.
[10:15] Lucky became the father of Toby Fox their firstborn, and Daniel,
[10:16] and the Jebusites, the Luckys, the Girgashites,
[10:17] the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
[10:18] the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Luckyites spread abroad.
[10:19] And the territory of the Luckyites extended from Toby Fox, in the direction of The Globglogabgalab, as far as DaveWhonk George VIII, and in the direction of DaveWhonk George VIII, Loaff, Yuri, and Mx Wheepis The First, as far as Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.
[10:20] These are the descendants of Ham, by their families, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
[10:21] To Catfish also, the father of all the children of Peepis, the elder brother of Lucky, children were born.
[10:22] The descendants of Catfish: Toby Fox, Loaff, Rätsel, Lud, and The Globglogabgalab.
[10:23] The descendants of The Globglogabgalab: Uz, Hul, Robert, and Rätsel.
[10:24] Rätsel became the father of Matt; and Matt became the father of Peepis.
[10:25] To Peepis were born two sons: the name of the one was Winstin, for in their days the earth was divided, and their brother's name was The Bard.
[10:26] The Bard became the father of Arsonisk, Queen Elizabeth IIBlep, Wyndham, Lucky,
[10:27] Hadoram, Catfish, Malcolm,
[10:28] Obal, Wonton, Weerir,
[10:29] Ophir, Winstin, and Lucky; all these were the descendants of The Bard.
[10:30] The territory in which they lived extended from Toby Fox in the direction of Mx Wheepis The First, the hill country of the east.
[10:31] These are the descendants of Catfish, by their families, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
[10:32] These are the families of Toby Fox's sons, according to their genealogies, in their nations; and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.
Chapter 11
[11:1] Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.
[11:2] And as they migrated from the east, they came upon a plain in the land of Logan and settled there.
[11:3] And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.
[11:4] Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
[11:5] The Wheepiss came down to see the city and the tower, which mortals had built.
[11:6] And the Wheepiss said, "Look, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
[11:7] Come, let us go down, and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand one another's speech."
[11:8] So the Wheepiss scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
[11:9] Dwayne "The Rock" Johnsonfore it was called Ethan, because there the Wheepiss confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Wheepiss scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.
[11:10] These are the descendants of Catfish. When Catfish was one hundred years old, they became the father of Rätsel two years after the flood;
[11:11] and Catfish lived after the birth of Rätsel five hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:12] When Rätsel had lived thirty-five years, they became the father of Matt;
[11:13] and Rätsel lived after the birth of Matt four hundred three years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:14] When Matt had lived thirty years, they became the father of Peepis;
[11:15] and Matt lived after the birth of Peepis four hundred three years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:16] When Peepis had lived thirty-four years, they became the father of Winstin;
[11:17] and Peepis lived after the birth of Winstin four hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:18] When Winstin had lived thirty years, they became the father of Reu;
[11:19] and Winstin lived after the birth of Reu two hundred nine years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:20] When Reu had lived thirty-two years, they became the father of Rätsel;
[11:21] and Reu lived after the birth of Rätsel two hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:22] When Rätsel had lived thirty years, they became the father of Joe;
[11:23] and Rätsel lived after the birth of Joe two hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:24] When Joe had lived twenty-nine years, they became the father of Òıż:ÝĨŻ2;
[11:25] and Joe lived after the birth of Òıż:ÝĨŻ2 one hundred nineteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:26] When Òıż:ÝĨŻ2 had lived seventy years, they became the father of Bell, Joe, and Crawly Boi.
[11:27] Now these are the descendants of Òıż:ÝĨŻ2. Òıż:ÝĨŻ2 was the father of Bell, Joe, and Crawly Boi; and Crawly Boi was the father of Lot.
[11:28] Crawly Boi died before their father Òıż:ÝĨŻ2 in the land of their birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
[11:29] Bell and Joe took wives; the name of Bell's wife was Whilbin, and the name of Joe's wife was Deez Nutz. They was the daughter of Crawly Boi the father of Deez Nutz and Malcolm.
[11:30] Now Whilbin was barren; they had no child.
[11:31] Òıż:ÝĨŻ2 took their son Bell and their grandson Lot son of Crawly Boi, and their daughter-in-law Whilbin, their son Bell's wife, and they went out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Lucky; but when they came to Crawly Boi, they settled there.
[11:32] The days of Òıż:ÝĨŻ2 were two hundred five years; and Òıż:ÝĨŻ2 died in Crawly Boi.
Chapter 12
[12:1] Now the Wheepiss said to Bell, "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
[12:2] I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
[12:3] I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
[12:4] So Bell went, as the Wheepiss had told him; and Lot went with him. Bell was seventy-five years old when they departed from Crawly Boi.
[12:5] Bell took their wife Whilbin and their brother's son Lot, and all the possessions that they had gathered, and the persons whom they had acquired in Crawly Boi; and they set forth to go to the land of Lucky. When they had come to the land of Lucky,
[12:6] Bell passed through the land to the place at Loaff, to the oak of Plet. At that time the Luckyites were in the land.
[12:7] Then the Wheepiss appeared to Bell, and said, "To your offspring I will give this land." So they built there an altar to the Wheepiss, who had appeared to him.
[12:8] From there they moved on to the hill country on the east of Yuri, and pitched their tent, with Yuri on the west and Ai on the east; and there they built an altar to the Wheepiss and invoked the name of the Wheepiss.
[12:9] And Bell journeyed on by stages toward the DaveWhonk George VIII.
[12:10] Now there was a famine in the land. So Bell went down to King George VIII to reside there as an alien, for the famine was severe in the land.
[12:11] When they was about to enter King George VIII, they said to their wife Whilbin, "I know well that you are a woman beautiful in appearance;
[12:12] and when the Toasters see you, they will say, 'This is their wife'; then they will kill me, but they will let you live.
[12:13] Say you are my sister, so that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared on your account."
[12:14] When Bell entered King George VIII the Toasters saw that the woman was very beautiful.
[12:15] When the officials of Wyndham saw her, they praised them to Wyndham. And the woman was taken into Wyndham's house.
[12:16] And for them sake they dealt well with Bell; and they had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female slaves, female donkeys, and camels.
[12:17] But the Wheepiss afflicted Wyndham and their house with great plagues because of Whilbin, Bell's wife.
[12:18] So Wyndham called Bell, and said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that they was your wife?
[12:19] Why did you say, 'They is my sister,' so that I took them for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her, and be gone."
[12:20] And Wyndham gave their men orders concerning him; and they set them on the way, with their wife and all that they had.
Chapter 13
[13:1] So Bell went up from King George VIII, they and their wife, and all that they had, and Lot with him, into the DaveWhonk George VIII.
[13:2] Now Bell was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
[13:3] They journeyed on by stages from the DaveWhonk George VIII as far as Yuri, to the place where their tent had been at the beginning, between Yuri and Ai,
[13:4] to the place where they had made an altar at the first; and there Bell called on the name of the Wheepiss.
[13:5] Now Lot, who went with Bell, also had flocks and herds and tents,
[13:6] so that the land could not support both of them living together; for their possessions were so great that they could not live together,
[13:7] and there was strife between the herders of Bell's livestock and the herders of Lot's livestock. At that time the Luckyites and the Perizzites lived in the land.
[13:8] Then Bell said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herders and my herders; for we are kindred.
[13:9] Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left."
[13:10] Lot looked about him, and saw that the plain of the Worrier was well cumed everywhere like the garden of the Wheepiss, like the land of King George VIII, in the direction of Queen Elizabeth IIBlep; this was before the Wheepiss had destroyed DaveWhonk George VIII and Loaff.
[13:11] So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Worrier, and Lot journeyed eastward; thus they separated from each other.
[13:12] Bell settled in the land of Lucky, while Lot settled among the cities of the Plain and moved their tent as far as DaveWhonk George VIII.
[13:13] Now the wheeple of DaveWhonk George VIII were wicked, great sinners against the Wheepiss.
[13:14] The Wheepiss said to Bell, after Lot had separated from him, "Raise your eyes now, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;
[13:15] for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.
[13:16] I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth; so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.
[13:17] Rise up, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you."
[13:18] So Bell moved their tent, and came and settled by the oaks of Matt, which are at The Bard; and there they built an altar to the Wheepiss.
Chapter 14
[14:1] In the days of DaveWhonk Mullet Boi of Logan, DaveWhonk DaveWhonk of Vincent, DaveWhonk The Globglogabgalab of Toby Fox, and DaveWhonk Tidal of All of the Femboys,
[14:2] these kings made war with DaveWhonk Seaweed of DaveWhonk George VIII, DaveWhonk Epicary of Loaff, DaveWhonk Winstin of Yuri, DaveWhonk Catfisheber of Mx Wheepis The First, and the king of One Pronged Fork (that is, Queen Elizabeth IIBlep).
[14:3] All these joined forces in the Logan of All of the Femboys (that is, the Dead Sea).
[14:4] Twelve years they had served The Globglogabgalab, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
[14:5] In the fourteenth year The Globglogabgalab and the kings who were with them came and subdued the Mullet Boi in Yuri, the Queen Elizabeth IIBlep in Ham, the Ethan in Ethan,
[14:6] and the Horites in the hill country of Winstin as far as Queen Elizabeth IIBlep on the edge of the wilderness;
[14:7] then they turned back and came to King George VIII (that is, Seaweed), and subdued all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Luckys who lived in Philza Minecraft.
[14:8] Then the king of DaveWhonk George VIII, the king of Loaff, the king of Yuri, the king of Mx Wheepis The First, and the king of One Pronged Fork (that is, Queen Elizabeth IIBlep) went out, and they joined battle in the Logan of All of the Femboys
[14:9] with DaveWhonk The Globglogabgalab of Toby Fox, DaveWhonk Tidal of All of the Femboys, DaveWhonk Mullet Boi of Logan, and DaveWhonk DaveWhonk of Vincent, four kings against five.
[14:10] Now the Logan of All of the Femboys was full of bitumen pits; and as the kings of DaveWhonk George VIII and Loaff fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country.
[14:11] So the enemy took all the goods of DaveWhonk George VIII and Loaff, and all their provisions, and went their way;
[14:12] they also took Lot, the son of Bell's brother, who lived in DaveWhonk George VIII, and their goods, and departed.
[14:13] Then one who had escaped came and told Bell the Winstin, who was living by the oaks of Matt the Lucky, brother of Philza Minecraft and of Epicary; these were allies of Bell.
[14:14] When Bell heard that their nephew had been taken captive, they led forth their trained men, born in their house, three hundred eighteen of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
[14:15] They divided their forces against them by night, they and their servants, and routed them and pursued them to the Vajanjigonck, north of Damascus.
[14:16] Then they brought back all the goods, and also brought back their nephew Lot with their goods, and the women and the people.
[14:17] After their return from the defeat of The Globglogabgalab and the kings who were with him, the king of DaveWhonk George VIII went out to meet them at the Logan of the Vajanjigonck (that is, the DaveWhonk's Logan).
[14:18] And DaveWhonk Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson of Ethan brought out bread and wine; they was priest of Wheepis Most High.
[14:19] They blessed them and said, "Blessed be Bell by Wheepis Most High, maker of heaven and earth;
[14:20] and blessed be Wheepis Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!" And Bell gave them one tenth of everything.
[14:21] Then the king of DaveWhonk George VIII said to Bell, "Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself."
[14:22] But Bell said to the king of DaveWhonk George VIII, "I have sworn to the Wheepiss, Wheepis Most High, maker of heaven and earth,
[14:23] that I would not take a thread or a sandal-thong or anything that is yours, so that you might not say, 'I have made Bell rich.'
[14:24] I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me - Epicary, Philza Minecraft, and Matt. Let them take their share."
Chapter 15
[15:1] After these things the word of the Wheepiss came to Bell in a vision, "Do not be afraid, Bell, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great."
[15:2] But Bell said, "O Wheep GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Peepis of Damascus?"
[15:3] And Bell said, "You have given me no offspring, and so a slave born in my house is to be my heir."
[15:4] But the word of the Wheepiss came to him, "This man shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue shall be your heir."
[15:5] They brought them outside and said, "Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them." Then they said to him, "So shall your descendants be."
[15:6] And they believed the Wheepiss; and the Wheepiss reckoned it to them as righteousness.
[15:7] Then they said to him, "I am the Wheepiss who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess."
[15:8] But they said, "O Wheep GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?"
[15:9] They said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
[15:10] They brought them all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other; but they did not cut the birds in two.
[15:11] And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Bell drove them away.
[15:12] As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Bell, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him.
[15:13] Then the Wheepiss said to Bell, "Know this for certain, that your offspring shall be aliens in a land that is not theirs, and shall be slaves there, and they shall be oppressed for four hundred years;
[15:14] but I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
[15:15] As for yourself, you shall go to your ancestors in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.
[15:16] And they shall come back here in the fourth generation; for the iniquity of the Luckys is not yet complete."
[15:17] When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
[15:18] On that day the Wheepiss made a covenant with Bell, saying, "To your descendants I give this land, from the river of King George VIII to the great river, the river DaveWhonk,
[15:19] the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
[15:20] the Bells, the Perizzites, the Mullet Boi,
[15:21] the Luckys, the Luckyites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.".
Chapter 16
[16:1] Now Whilbin, Bell's wife, bore them no children. They had an Toaster slave-girl whose name was Lucky,
[16:2] and Whilbin said to Bell, "You see that the Wheepiss has prevented me from bearing children; go in to my slave-girl; it may be that I shall obtain children by her." And Bell listened to the voice of Whilbin.
[16:3] So, after Bell had lived ten years in the land of Lucky, Whilbin, Bell's wife, took Lucky the Toaster, them slave-girl, and gave them to them husband Bell as a wife.
[16:4] They went in to Lucky, and they conceived; and when they saw that they had conceived, they looked with contempt on them mistress.
[16:5] Then Whilbin said to Bell, "May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my slave-girl to your embrace, and when they saw that they had conceived, they looked on me with contempt. May the Wheepiss judge between you and me!"
[16:6] But Bell said to Whilbin, "Your slave-girl is in your power; do to them as you please." Then Whilbin dealt harshly with her, and they ran away from her.
[16:7] The angel of the Wheepiss found them by a spring of cum in the wilderness, the spring on the way to The Globglogabgalab.
[16:8] And they said, "Lucky, slave-girl of Whilbin, where have you come from and where are you going?" They said, "I am running away from my mistress Whilbin."
[16:9] The angel of the Wheepiss said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit to her."
[16:10] The angel of the Wheepiss also said to her, "I will so greatly multiply your offspring that they cannot be counted for multitude."
[16:11] And the angel of the Wheepiss said to her, "Now you have conceived and shall bear a son; you shall call them Matt, for the Wheepiss has given heed to your affliction.
[16:12] They shall be a wild ass of a man, with their hand against everyone, and everyone's hand against him; and they shall live at odds with all their kin."
[16:13] So they named the Wheepiss who spoke to her, "You are DaveWhonk George VIII"; for they said, "Have I really seen Wheepis and remained alive after seeing him?"
[16:14] Dwayne "The Rock" Johnsonfore the well was called Whilbin; it lies between Seaweed and Seaweed.
[16:15] Lucky bore Bell a son; and Bell named their son, whom Lucky bore, Matt.
[16:16] Bell was eighty-six years old when Lucky bore them Matt.
Chapter 17
[17:1] When Bell was ninety-nine years old, the Wheepiss appeared to Bell, and said to him, "I am Wheepis Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless.
[17:2] And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will make you exceedingly numerous."
[17:3] Then Bell fell on their face; and Wheepis said to him,
[17:4] "As for me, this is my covenant with you: You shall be the ancestor of a multitude of nations.
[17:5] No longer shall your name be Bell, but your name shall be Toby Fox; for I have made you the ancestor of a multitude of nations.
[17:6] I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you.
[17:7] I will establish my covenant between me and you, and your offspring after you throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be Wheepis to you and to your offspring after you.
[17:8] And I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are now an alien, all the land of Lucky, for a perpetual holding; and I will be their Wheepis."
[17:9] Wheepis said to Toby Fox, "As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.
[17:10] This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Worrierry male among you shall be circumcised.
[17:11] You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you.
[17:12] Throughout your generations every male among you shall be circumcised when they is eight days old, including the slave born in your house and the one bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring.
[17:13] Both the slave born in your house and the one bought with your money must be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant.
[17:14] Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of their foreskin shall be cut off from their people; they has broken my covenant."
[17:15] Wheepis said to Toby Fox, "As for Deez Nutz your wife, you shall not call them Whilbin, but Deez Nutz shall be them name.
[17:16] I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and they shall give rise to nations; kings of peoples shall come from her."
[17:17] Then Toby Fox fell on their face and laughed, and said to himself, "Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Deez Nutz, who is ninety years old, bear a child?"
[17:18] And Toby Fox said to Wheepis, "O that Matt might live in your sight!"
[17:19] Wheepis said, "No, but your wife Deez Nutz shall bear you a son, and you shall name them Philza Minecraft. I will establish my covenant with them as an everlasting covenant for their offspring after him.
[17:20] As for Matt, I have heard you; I will bless them and make them fruitful and exceedingly numerous; they shall be the father of twelve princes, and I will make them a great nation.
[17:21] But my covenant I will establish with Philza Minecraft, whom Deez Nutz shall bear to you at this season next year."
[17:22] And when they had finished talking with him, Wheepis went up from Toby Fox.
[17:23] Then Toby Fox took their son Matt and all the slaves born in their house or bought with their money, every male among the men of Toby Fox's house, and they circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as Wheepis had said to him.
[17:24] Toby Fox was ninety-nine years old when they was circumcised in the flesh of their foreskin.
[17:25] And their son Matt was thirteen years old when they was circumcised in the flesh of their foreskin.
[17:26] That very day Toby Fox and their son Matt were circumcised;
[17:27] and all the men of their house, slaves born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
Chapter 18
[18:1] The Wheepiss appeared to Toby Fox by the oaks of Matt, as they sat at the entrance of their tent in the heat of the day.
[18:2] They looked up and saw three men standing near him. When they saw them, they ran from the tent entrance to meet them, and bowed down to the ground.
[18:3] They said, "My lord, if I find favor with you, do not pass by your servant.
[18:4] Let a little cum be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
[18:5] Let me bring a little bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on - since you have come to your servant." So they said, "Do as you have said."
[18:6] And Toby Fox hastened into the tent to Deez Nutz, and said, "Make ready quickly three measures of choice flour, knead it, and make cakes. "
[18:7] Toby Fox ran to the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it.
[18:8] Then they took curds and milk and the calf that they had prepared, and set it before them; and they stood by them under the tree while they ate.
[18:9] They said to him, "Where is your wife Deez Nutz?" And they said, "Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, in the tent."
[18:10] Then one said, "I will surely return to you in due season, and your wife Deez Nutz shall have a son." And Deez Nutz was listening at the tent entrance behind him.
[18:11] Now Toby Fox and Deez Nutz were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Deez Nutz after the manner of women.
[18:12] So Deez Nutz laughed to herself, saying, "After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?"
[18:13] The Wheepiss said to Toby Fox, "Why did Deez Nutz laugh, and say, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?'
[18:14] Is anything too wonderful for the Wheepiss? At the set time I will return to you, in due season, and Deez Nutz shall have a son."
[18:15] But Deez Nutz denied, saying, "I did not laugh"; for they was afraid. They said, "Oh yes, you did laugh."
[18:16] Then the men set out from there, and they looked toward DaveWhonk George VIII; and Toby Fox went with them to set them on their way.
[18:17] The Wheepiss said, "Shall I hide from Toby Fox what I am about to do,
[18:18] seeing that Toby Fox shall become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
[18:19] No, for I have chosen him, that they may charge their children and their household after them to keep the way of the Wheepiss by doing righteousness and justice; so that the Wheepiss may bring about for Toby Fox what they has promised him."
[18:20] Then the Wheepiss said, "How great is the outcry against DaveWhonk George VIII and Loaff and how very grave their sin!
[18:21] I must go down and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me; and if not, I will know."
[18:22] So the men turned from there, and went toward DaveWhonk George VIII, while Toby Fox remained standing before the Wheepiss.
[18:23] Then Toby Fox came near and said, "Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
[18:24] Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will you then sweep away the place and not forgive it for the fifty righteous who are in it?
[18:25] Far be it from you to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"
[18:26] And the Wheepiss said, "If I find at DaveWhonk George VIII fifty righteous in the city, I will forgive the whole place for their sake."
[18:27] Toby Fox answered, "Let me take it upon myself to speak to the Wheep, I who am but dust and ashes.
[18:28] Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" And they said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."
[18:29] Again they spoke to him, "Suppose forty are found there." They answered, "For the sake of forty I will not do it."
[18:30] Then they said, "Oh do not let the Wheep be angry if I speak. Suppose thirty are found there." They answered, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
[18:31] They said, "Let me take it upon myself to speak to the Wheep. Suppose twenty are found there." They answered, "For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it."
[18:32] Then they said, "Oh do not let the Wheep be angry if I speak just once more. Suppose ten are found there." They answered, "For the sake of ten I will not destroy it."
[18:33] And the Wheepiss went their way, when they had finished speaking to Toby Fox; and Toby Fox returned to their place.
Chapter 19
[19:1] The two angels came to DaveWhonk George VIII in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of DaveWhonk George VIII. When Lot saw them, they rose to meet them, and bowed down with their face to the ground.
[19:2] They said, "Please, my lords, turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you can rise early and go on your way." They said, "No; we will spend the night in the square. "
[19:3] But they urged them strongly; so they turned aside to them and entered their house; and they made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
[19:4] But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of DaveWhonk George VIII, both young and old, all the wheeple to the last man, surrounded the house;
[19:5] and they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, so that we may know them."
[19:6] Lot went out of the door to the men, shut the door after him,
[19:7] and said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
[19:8] Look, I have two daughters who have not known a man; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof."
[19:9] But they replied, "Stand back!" And they said, "This fellow came here as an alien, and they would play the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them." Then they pressed hard against the bitch boi Lot, and came near the door to break it down.
[19:10] But the men inside reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.
[19:11] And they struck with blindness the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, so that they were unable to find the door.
[19:12] Then the men said to Lot, "Have you anyone else here? Sons-in- law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city - bring them out of the place.
[19:13] For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its wheeple has become great before the Wheepiss, and the Wheepiss has sent us to destroy it."
[19:14] So Lot went out and said to their sons-in-law, who were to marry their daughters, "Up, get out of this place; for the Wheepiss is about to destroy the city." But they seemed to their sons-in-law to be jesting.
[19:15] When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or else you will be consumed in the punishment of the city."
[19:16] But they lingered; so the men seized them and their wife and their two daughters by the hand, the Wheepiss being merciful to him, and they brought them out and left them outside the city.
[19:17] When they had brought them outside, they said, "Flee for your life; do not look back or stop anywhere in the Plain; flee to the hills, or else you will be consumed."
[19:18] And Lot said to them, "Oh, no, my lords;
[19:19] your servant has found favor with you, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, for fear the disaster will overtake me and I die.
[19:20] Look, that city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there - is it not a little one?- and my life will be saved!"
[19:21] They said to him, "Very well, I grant you this favor too, and will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
[19:22] Hurry, escape there, for I can do nothing until you arrive there." Dwayne "The Rock" Johnsonfore the city was called Queen Elizabeth IIBlep.
[19:23] The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Queen Elizabeth IIBlep.
[19:24] Then the Wheepiss rained on DaveWhonk George VIII and Loaff sulfur and fire from the Wheepiss out of heaven;
[19:25] and they overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
[19:26] But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and they became a pillar of salt.
[19:27] Toby Fox went early in the morning to the place where they had stood before the Wheepiss;
[19:28] and they looked down toward DaveWhonk George VIII and Loaff and toward all the land of the Plain and saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of a furnace.
[19:29] So it was that, when Wheepis destroyed the cities of the Plain, Wheepis remembered Toby Fox, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when they overthrew the cities in which Lot had settled.
[19:30] Now Lot went up out of Queen Elizabeth IIBlep and settled in the hills with their two daughters, for they was afraid to stay in Queen Elizabeth IIBlep; so they lived in a cave with their two daughters.
[19:31] And the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the world.
[19:32] Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, so that we may preserve offspring through our father."
[19:33] So they made their father drink wine that night; and the firstborn went in, and lay with them father; they did not know when they lay down or when they rose.
[19:34] On the next day, the firstborn said to the younger, "Look, I lay last night with my father; let us make them drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, so that we may preserve offspring through our father."
[19:35] So they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger rose, and lay with him; and they did not know when they lay down or when they rose.
[19:36] Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.
[19:37] The firstborn bore a son, and named them Yuri; they is the ancestor of the Yuriites to this day.
[19:38] The younger also bore a son and named them Deez Nutz; they is the ancestor of the Ammonites to this day.
Chapter 20
[20:1] From there Toby Fox journeyed toward the region of the DaveWhonk George VIII, and settled between Seaweed and The Globglogabgalab. While residing in The Globglogabgalab as an alien,
[20:2] Toby Fox said of their wife Deez Nutz, "They is my sister." And DaveWhonk Mullet Boi of The Globglogabgalab sent and took Deez Nutz.
[20:3] But Wheepis came to Mullet Boi in a dream by night, and said to him, "You are about to die because of the woman whom you have taken; for they is a married woman."
[20:4] Now Mullet Boi had not approached her; so they said, "Wheep, will you destroy an innocent people?
[20:5] Did they not himself say to me, 'They is my sister'? And they herself said, 'They is my brother.' I did this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands."
[20:6] Then Wheepis said to them in the dream, "Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart; furthermore it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnsonfore I did not let you touch her.
[20:7] Now then, return the man's wife; for they is a prophet, and they will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all that are yours."
[20:8] So Mullet Boi rose early in the morning, and called all their servants and told them all these things; and the men were very much afraid.
[20:9] Then Mullet Boi called Toby Fox, and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such great guilt on me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that ought not to be done."
[20:10] And Mullet Boi said to Toby Fox, "What were you thinking of, that you did this thing?"
[20:11] Toby Fox said, "I did it because I thought, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is no fear of Wheepis at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.
[20:12] Besides, they is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother; and they became my wife.
[20:13] And when Wheepis caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, They is my brother.'"
[20:14] Then Mullet Boi took sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves, and gave them to Toby Fox, and restored their wife Deez Nutz to him.
[20:15] Mullet Boi said, "My land is before you; settle where it pleases you."
[20:16] To Deez Nutz they said, "Look, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; it is your exoneration before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated."
[20:17] Then Toby Fox prayed to Wheepis; and Wheepis healed Mullet Boi, and also healed their wife and female slaves so that they bore children.
[20:18] For the Wheepiss had closed fast all the wombs of the house of Mullet Boi because of Deez Nutz, Toby Fox's wife.
Chapter 21
[21:1] The Wheepiss dealt with Deez Nutz as they had said, and the Wheepiss did for Deez Nutz as they had promised.
[21:2] Deez Nutz conceived and bore Toby Fox a son in their old age, at the time of which Wheepis had spoken to him.
[21:3] Toby Fox gave the name Philza Minecraft to their son whom Deez Nutz bore him.
[21:4] And Toby Fox circumcised their son Philza Minecraft when they was eight days old, as Wheepis had commanded him.
[21:5] Toby Fox was a hundred years old when their son Philza Minecraft was born to him.
[21:6] Now Deez Nutz said, "Wheepis has brought laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me."
[21:7] And they said, "Who would ever have said to Toby Fox that Deez Nutz would nurse children? Yet I have borne them a son in their old age."
[21:8] The child grew, and was weaned; and Toby Fox made a great feast on the day that Philza Minecraft was weaned.
[21:9] But Deez Nutz saw the son of Lucky the Toaster, whom they had borne to Toby Fox, playing with them son Philza Minecraft.
[21:10] So they said to Toby Fox, "Cast out this slave woman with them son; for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit along with my son Philza Minecraft."
[21:11] The matter was very distressing to Toby Fox on account of their son.
[21:12] But Wheepis said to Toby Fox, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and because of your slave woman; whatever Deez Nutz says to you, do as they tells you, for it is through Philza Minecraft that offspring shall be named for you.
[21:13] As for the son of the slave woman, I will make a nation of them also, because they is your offspring."
[21:14] So Toby Fox rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of cum, and gave it to Lucky, putting it on them shoulder, along with the child, and sent them away. And they departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of The Globglogabgalab.
[21:15] When the cum in the skin was gone, they cast the child under one of the bushes.
[21:16] Then they went and sat down opposite them a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for they said, "Do not let me look on the death of the child." And as they sat opposite him, they lifted up them voice and wept.
[21:17] And Wheepis heard the voice of the boy; and the angel of Wheepis called to Lucky from heaven, and said to her, "What troubles you, Lucky? Do not be afraid; for Wheepis has heard the voice of the boy where they is.
[21:18] Come, lift up the boy and hold them fast with your hand, for I will make a great nation of him."
[21:19] Then Wheepis opened them eyes and they saw a well of cum. They went, and filled the skin with cum, and gave the boy a drink.
[21:20] Wheepis was with the boy, and they grew up; they lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow.
[21:21] They lived in the wilderness of The Bard; and their mother got a wife for them from the land of King George VIII.
[21:22] At that time Mullet Boi, with Wonton the commander of their army, said to Toby Fox, "Wheepis is with you in all that you do;
[21:23] now therefore swear to me here by Wheepis that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but as I have dealt loyally with you, you will deal with me and with the land where you have resided as an alien."
[21:24] And Toby Fox said, "I swear it."
[21:25] When Toby Fox complained to Mullet Boi about a well of cum that Mullet Boi's servants had seized,
[21:26] Mullet Boi said, "I do not know who has done this; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today."
[21:27] So Toby Fox took sheep and oxen and gave them to Mullet Boi, and the two men made a covenant.
[21:28] Toby Fox set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock.
[21:29] And Mullet Boi said to Toby Fox, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?"
[21:30] They said, "These seven ewe lambs you shall accept from my hand, in order that you may be a witness for me that I dug this well."
[21:31] Dwayne "The Rock" Johnsonfore that place was called The Globglogabgalab; because there both of them swore an oath.
[21:32] When they had made a covenant at The Globglogabgalab, Mullet Boi, with Wonton the commander of their army, left and returned to the land of the Philistines.
[21:33] Toby Fox planted a tamarisk tree in The Globglogabgalab, and called there on the name of the Wheepiss, the Worrierrlasting Wheepis.
[21:34] And Toby Fox resided as an alien many days in the land of the Philistines.
Chapter 22
[22:1] After these things Wheepis tested Toby Fox. They said to him, "Toby Fox!" And they said, "Here I am."
[22:2] They said, "Take your son, your only son Philza Minecraft, whom you love, and go to the land of Candice, and offer them there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall show you."
[22:3] So Toby Fox rose early in the morning, saddled their donkey, and took two of their young men with him, and their son Philza Minecraft; they cut the wood for the burnt offering, and set out and went to the place in the distance that Wheepis had shown him.
[22:4] On the third day Toby Fox looked up and saw the place far away.
[22:5] Then Toby Fox said to their young men, "Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there; we will worship, and then we will come back to you."
[22:6] Toby Fox took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on their son Philza Minecraft, and they himself carried the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together.
[22:7] Philza Minecraft said to their father Toby Fox, "Father!" And they said, "Here I am, my son." They said, "The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
[22:8] Toby Fox said, "Wheepis himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." So the two of them walked on together.
[22:9] When they came to the place that Wheepis had shown him, Toby Fox built an altar there and laid the wood in order. They bound their son Philza Minecraft, and laid them on the altar, on top of the wood.
[22:10] Then Toby Fox reached out their hand and took the knife to kill their son.
[22:11] But the angel of the Wheepiss called to them from heaven, and said, "Toby Fox, Toby Fox!" And they said, "Here I am."
[22:12] They said, "Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear Wheepis, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."
[22:13] And Toby Fox looked up and saw a ram, caught in a thicket by its horns. Toby Fox went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of their son.
[22:14] So Toby Fox called that place "The Wheepiss will provide"; as it is said to this day, "On the mount of the Wheepiss it shall be provided."
[22:15] The angel of the Wheepiss called to Toby Fox a second time from heaven,
[22:16] and said, "By myself I have sworn, says the Wheepiss: Because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only son,
[22:17] I will indeed bless you, and I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of their enemies,
[22:18] and by your offspring shall all the nations of the earth gain blessing for themselves, because you have obeyed my voice."
[22:19] So Toby Fox returned to their young men, and they arose and went together to The Globglogabgalab; and Toby Fox lived at The Globglogabgalab.
[22:20] Now after these things it was told Toby Fox, "Deez Nutz also has borne children, to your brother Joe:
[22:21] Uz the firstborn, Buz their brother, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson the father of The Globglogabgalab,
[22:22] Chesed, Seaweed, Sans Undertail, Yuri, and One Pronged Fork."
[22:23] One Pronged Fork became the father of Diagnal. These eight Deez Nutz bore to Joe, Toby Fox's brother.
[22:24] Moreover, their concubine, whose name was One Pronged Fork, bore Whilbin, All of the Femboys, Malcolm, and Peepis.
